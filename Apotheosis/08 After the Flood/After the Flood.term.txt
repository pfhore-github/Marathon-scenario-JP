It's clear that Noah still carries damage from the crash, and I'm not sure I entirely trust his judgement. We do, however, have no other available choice.

He's prepared a communications interrupt chip for you. As soon as you install it on the local network, we will gain a back door to the secure layer of the Pfhor data net.

A heavy blast door on the lower level of the complex controls access to this dig site.

Take care in your approach: resistance will be heavy.

We were lucky, I suppose, that the abandoned native information network seems to lend higher degrees of complexity to the areas surrounding each of the gates we have discovered so far.

If only we could vanquish the constant line-noise in the network.

Presumably we are causing the interference -- the harder we push into the network, the harder the network pushes back.

As we progress, I can detect an increased number of uncatalogued network nodes. It is almost as if the network is being continually rebuilt, or our presence alone is awaking some form of distributed network.

The Pfhor have disabled their secondary power routers. I need you to cycle the hard reset located at the base of each router. You will then have access to the central atrium's twin security stations. You will find blast door controls there.

Noah has gained us access to an internal teleport matrix. We should now have access to the remainder of this base, located deep beneath this site.

Following our as$C5sau$C0lt on the base where you no$C5w s$C0tand, the Pfhor have begun mobilising troops to attempt to neutralise us.

We have no choice b$C1ut$C0 to enter the deeper catacombs, which are only accessible by a closed-loop teleportation system.
