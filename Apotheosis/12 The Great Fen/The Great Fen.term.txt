      The Book Of Uprising
.I$C1

          before time
we swam deeply in the Great Fen
our eyes were closed and unknown
and the Low Caves were our home

  the Two were born of the sky
     the might of the Yah Roh
   the splendour of the Pth Yah

        and with the Two
           time began

$C1   the Two split the Great Fen
    and the Low Caves ran dry

   the Two spoke unto the stone
     and our eyes were opened

  the Two blessed us with metal
       we swam in the sky
and the Low Caves became our home

   the Two blessed us with soul
      and knowledge of stone

    the Two spoke the Command
    and joyfully, we accepted

   the Two swam beyond the sky
      and passed beyond time

    as we fulfilled the Command
         the gateways opened
   and soul and stone blessed us

      our thoughts grew deep
   and we housed our blessings
         in great Citadels

     the time of Angels began
