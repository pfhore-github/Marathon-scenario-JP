Fate smiles on us. It would seem the Pfhor forgot to lock down a teleport knot on the refuelling station. I hope you like the fresh supply of ammo.

Moored above, you will find the $ICalm Horizons$i â€“ The craft I want to take us home.

The controls for the 2 stage crew umbilical are located around the refuelling cradle's perimeter.

Once aboard, disable the hardware locks on the fuel-conversion matrices before making your way to the control room.

Other than that, you know what to do.

Kill.

Phan'Shrrh$i $C7(?Swarm)$C2 Aggressive Depopulation Units may prove hazardous to Secure Cargo Module 4E4.

Humbly I note that Secure Cargo Module 4E4 is likely of utmost importance to native transport matrix Acquisition Project 1AE, and request confirmation of Fenris Command directive.F13E.

One job left to do.

Disable the hardware locks on the fuel-conversion matrices at the aft of the ship.

There are two matrices in total.

Once you've disabled the locks, return here, and we can go home.

Soon we will warn Surrex of the threat we have discovered.

Good work.

The ship is ready for the journey back. Hopefully, Noah's subterfuge on the planetary net should delay the Pfhor's discovery of our actions until we have warned Surrex Prime.

Noah cannot join us. He's an unknown factor that I can't risk introducing to Surrex Net now.

I hope he can survive as a rogue AI in the Pfhor network on Fenris. I will miss him.

Ready for jump.
