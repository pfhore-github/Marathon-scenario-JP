     all tyrants must be silenced

            the heart of Angels
         must be left to Angels

     you stand at a nexus
     but for now,
     your path remains here$C4

     the coiling path of chaos
     sleeps in a star

                  it has come to pass
     that the cold, hard path of void
               is the greatest threat
                  this universe knows$C4

     when the time is right
     justice will be done
     though the heavens fall

       for now, however, and as ever
                 a sword must return
    for the final days of its master$C4
