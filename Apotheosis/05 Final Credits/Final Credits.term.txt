The Pfhor attack on this base is particularly adamant. I must admit, I was surprised to find such a sparsely defended clean AI core when I first secured this facility.

The core seems more like a junction point for accelerated communication between several isolated cells. Pfhor-built AI are usually relatively centralised; it makes them easier to control.

Something is going on here that I don't yet understand.

The Pfhor have destroyed the outermost perimeter with tactical explosives and have begun to move in.

A series of blast doors gate the inner facility; I want you to lock each door and repel the incoming Pfhor. I will maintain a secondary lockdown until the threat at each perimeter wall is sufficiently neutralised.

I need you to hold off the Pfhor attack for as long as possible. Maintain the blockade while I attempt to mobilise forces to pull my core.

I'm afraid I've had to assume the worst about the Venator -- we've lost communications with her, and traffic on the Pfhor battle net would indicate her destruction.

Noah, too, is entirely incommunicado. What remains of crash pod E104-A has been cut off from the Pfhor net by impenetrable pulses of white noise.

For the time being, it would seem that we are alone.

My attempts to lift my core have failed. The defence squad I mobilised is un-reachable and presumed dead.

I'm sending you in personally to do the job.

Good luck.
