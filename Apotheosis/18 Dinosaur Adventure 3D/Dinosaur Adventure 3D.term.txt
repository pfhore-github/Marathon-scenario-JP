The ESR Astra Personal Matter Cannon is a miniaturised implementation of ESR Industrial-Class Matter Driver Cannons.

The essential rules of operation are the same as the original: point muzzle away from face, and try not to be standing within spitting distance of your intended target.$C4

You are currently standing on the loading deck of a weapons platform in distant orbit around Surrex Prime. The weapons lab is on the upper level, accessible via the station's main freight elevator.

If the Pfhor have such a sturdy grip on many of our defensive hardware production facilities, we need the extra firepower afforded by experimental weapons tech. 

Act quickly, my friend. We have no idea how long we have until the Pfhor attack and need all the time we can spare.

Like an impending storm, the final battle now hangs on the horizon. 

Godspeed.

The electron shockwaves which just rocked the station were the combined matter displacement shockwaves of $Ithree entire Pfhor battlegroups$i entering the system.

Surrex colony, and the amassed human military presence here, can withstand $Ione.

And yet, this is not the worst of it.

In our haste to warn Surrex Prime of the Pfhor presence on Fenris, not only did we show the Pfhor the way, $Iwe brought them here.

It seems the Pfhor had placed a modified  Gate node in a radiation-sealed container inside the central cargo bay on the ship we acquired from the refuelling station. It was a set-up.

They have taken advantage of the fact that we had access to safe low-orbit flight patterns, and we have helped them install a remarkable military force millions of kilometres within the usual safe range.

It is too late for regret. We must do whatever we can to stop the Pfhor, no matter the cost. Once the Pfhor take Surrex, locating Sol will become child's play.

Unless we act swiftly, the human empire will fall at our hands.
