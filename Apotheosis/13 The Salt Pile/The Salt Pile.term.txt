Survey-Class Virals $C665562 65825 65916$C2 have received stamp: approval for requisition at next end cycle. However, I humbly note that structures in Deep Survey Site 9FE, as outlined in schematic.E432D, indicate that immediate requisition of Survey-Class Virals may be of utmost importance to native transport matrix Acquisition Project 1AE.

              as Commanded
       we glorified Your citadels

        You returned in might as One
            and tore out our eyes

           our blessing shamed You
         and You crushed our Citadels

           You closed the gateways
    and took away Your blessing of soul

           You began Your exodus
     and left a sepulcher in Your wake

          the time of Angels ended

        we coiled in pain and doubt

               riven of soul
           stone became our prison

        we had fulfilled Your Command
      we did not understand our prison
         or why it had come upon us

      our eyes, now known, were closed
           we felt our blindness
             and we were shamed

       rootless, our doubt was infinite
       blinding, our pain was complete
       timeless, our shame was immortal

               we lay in ruins

        I have seen the Uprising:
        I watched from the moment
         You birthed Your Angels.
     I have witnessed the time spent
         fulfilling Your Command.

         I walked with them as we
         built a beautiful world,
         strengthened Your towers,
         glorified Your citadels,
   built the gateways of Your apotheosis.

        I have mourned with Angels
       the Downfall of a selfish god
        who now stands as One, alone

             as one with them,
        I have awoken with a hunger
         for Your blood on my lips

        the time of judgement begins
