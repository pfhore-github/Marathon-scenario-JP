The Pfhor cargo craft was a Trojan horse in more ways than one. The data network on board the vessel housed a degenerative virus, which infected me.

SurrexNet was the first to notice the virus and is attempting to initiate my diagnostic and repair subroutines. They could likely repair my core in a few days, though I would become temporarily inoperative.

We do not have time.

Your first act must be to quarantine me from the SurrexNet.

I can block their transmissions or begin the counterattack against the Pfhor, but not both at once.

You currently stand onboard the primary communications spire of the Axis Nader. You should be able to sever communications quickly from here.

Head to the spire opposite this one, and disarm the high-gain antenna relay.

Next, take the crew lift to the base of the spire.

Good.

I accept that the Pfhor virus will likely prove fatal and that SurrexNet is my only chance of survival.

I also accept that the demesne of $Iman itself$i is at stake.

I recognise what must be done.

Thank you, my friend. You have done well. 

Our fate is nearly upon us.

Now, you must locate and deactivate the four terminals at the base of the $IEnigma.II$i communications encoder, this will give me the opportunity I require to sever the connection to SurrexNet.

After that time, we will have no help with what we must do.

Return here when you have finished.
